Best practices for coding:

1. class names camelcase, everything else with _
2. if a function modifies hidden state it should be a method belonging to the object it modifies. Elsewise it should be a function.
3. Functions are not allowed to change hidden state of an object.
4. Avoid pointers when convienience is equal.
5. Use references or structs for extra return values
6. Good function / variable names are better than comments.
7. Operator overloading is evil but powerfull.
8. Avoid includes in header files. This reduces dependencies and compile time.
